## 🚀 Tech Stack
We built this app using the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) 

## ✨ Ranking System
To track the best scores, we ask players for their name, which is stored using `cookies` and `local storage`. This simple approach is enough for the people that may try this little game, more than this would create friction 😁

## 🛠️ Admin Dashboard
An admin dashboard is available (for internal use) to view all scores, not just the top 5.
